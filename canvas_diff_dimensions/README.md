# Testing canvases of different sizes

Example where two canvases are the same height but the underlying images are different sizes:

 * [Manifest](https://glenrobson.github.io/iiif_stuff/canvas_diff_dimensions/manifest-normalised.json)
 * [UV](https://uv-v3.netlify.app/#?c=&m=&s=&cv=&manifest=https://glenrobson.github.io/iiif_stuff/canvas_diff_dimensions/manifest-normalised.json)
 * [Mirador](https://projectmirador.org/embed/?iiif-content=https://glenrobson.github.io/iiif_stuff/canvas_diff_dimensions/manifest-normalised.json)

Example where two canvases should have different heights as the second image is smaller than the earlier one.
